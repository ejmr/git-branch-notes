# git branch-notes
#
# This script provides a Git command that keeps a database of notes on
# branches.  The intent is to help project maintainers keep track of
# details on branches, such as which ones to merge, particular commits
# to cherry-pick, and so on.  See the file 'README.markdown' for more
# information about how to use the program.
